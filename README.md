# iaed_proj2

## Overview

This project implements a small task planner, which allows tasks to have a description and a duration, as well as task-prerequisites and successors.
Also allows for the calculation of the critical path (sequence of tasks whose delay would result in the delay of the whole project)

## Context

This project was developed in the context of the introductory class to Algorithms and Data Structures at IST (Spring 2018)
